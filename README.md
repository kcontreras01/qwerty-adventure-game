###The approach taken
I decided to have the scenes in an array of objects. Because the elements were in key:value pairs they were easier to access in the DOM.

After creating scenes in the objects I nested an object for the choices. In these objects the choices become linked to the next scene depending on the person's answer. 

###Unsolved problems
Changing Qwerty image depending on the scene
Changing last scene to have a new class
